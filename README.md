# Pokemon Catch Front end test

This is a test for an Angular App creation, and uses:

Node v10.5.0
Angular CLI: 6.0.8

## First steps

After cloning this repo run

```
npm install
```

This will load all needed libraries.

## Development server

Once completed run
```
ng serve
``` 

Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` and you'll see the app running.

Thanks!
